                    <p style="text-align: right;">The mod includes a small quest in Baldur's Gate I, in which you assist a powerful Shadovar mage, Kryn Darkflame, in finding his lost apprentices. The quest may be started by exploring the Friendly Arm Inn courtyard, upon which the questgiver will make an entrance. Kryn also serves as a vendor of spells and magical items, providing shadow scrolls should you have a shadow adept within the party.<br><br>There are no quests in Baldur's Gate II nor Icewind Dale as of right now.</p>

Additionally, for the duration of the spell, the caster is surrounded by an illusory duplicate of &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self, copying ann their actions. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual shadow adept. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack—magical or otherwise—it reforms after a brief moment. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.<br><br>From 13th level onwards, this spell generates two duplicates, and from 18th level onwards, it generates three.</p>

Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self and fellow party members.

Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage dealt towards the target is reduced by 1, while the target's damage dice are increased by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead. Bonuses increase by the original amount for every five caster levels after 3rd level up to 23rd level. This spell also makes the target immune to effects that reduce luck, such as Doom or Greater Malison.</p>

However, for each round the link is maintained, the caster loses 10% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hit points (Save vs. Death at -4 to avoid) and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is completely vulnerable to attack unless &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; breaks the connection. Additionally, if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; ends the channel, the backlash causes &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; to become stunned for 2 rounds unless a Save vs. Death at -2 is made.</p>

For one turn, the shadow adept is safe from combat and &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hit points are restored to full, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; regains two arcane spells of each spell level of 7th level and below when &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; returns. In addition, as the caster will be resting for a long period of time, all effects whether beneficial or otherwise will be removed when they return.<br><br>The shadow adept may choose to return from the refuge before its duration has expired, but &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will only get partial benefits.</p>

For 1 turn, the target ally is resurrected with full hit points and dramatically increased power - the resurrected ally is hasted for the duration, Strength and Dexterity are set to 25, base AC is set to -6 and target gains immunity to all mind-affecting spells. The target deals maximum damage for the duration of the spell and their casting speed is increased by 4. However, this spell does not truly resurrect the target - once the spell has expired, the target dies again, regardless of their current hit points.</p>

However, telltale traces – a shimmering – allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. Additionally, for as long as the caster is at least partially invisible, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is healed for 1d6 hit points per round for the duration.<br><br>Note: After making an attack, the caster is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the caster. The caster is treated as Non-Detected for the duration.</p>

This skin is of course magical and will hinder the shadow adept in no way. The effect of this is to protect the shadow adept from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level shadow adept would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level shadow adept would receive 10. For each skin the shadow adept possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level shadow adept would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, but the 6th would affect &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; normally. The skins will remain on the shadow adept until &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the shadow adept from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.<br><br>Additionally, so long as at least one layer of Shadeskin is active, the shadow adept gains 25% resistance to acid, cold, fire, electrical and magic damage.</p>

Two arrows are launched from 12th level onwards, three at 19th level, and four at 26th level.

This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the effective level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled (Sunder Magic is cast as though at 1.5x the caster's actual level). The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Sunder Magic is above the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Sunder Magic is below the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.<br><br>Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.</p>

Beguile affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.<br><br>If the spell's recipient fails &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throw, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.<br><br>If the caster harms - or attempts to harm - the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Beguile spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is charmed.<br><br>The saving throw penalty increases by -1 for every 5 caster levels.</p>

The Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points and statistics last for 1 hour.<br><br>Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's Hit Points. The caster must wait for the first Lifedrinker Touch spell to run its course before casting another.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Alegreya, serif;font-size: 16px;">The Shadow Weave is an imitation of Mystra’s Weave, created by Shar. Though it is practiced by few due to its dangers of creating a pact with the goddess of night and loss, those who choose to draw power from the Shadow Weave despite its risks become Shadow Adepts, magicians who exchange their own life force to call upon powerful magic to bend wills, ensnare minds and deceive the senses. Those who become experienced with the Shadow Art are able to call upon powers others could only dream of.<br><br>This mod allows the player to become a Shadow Adept, a mage which is unable to use regular arcane magic, but uses Shadow Weave magic instead, having a selection of roughly a dozen spells for each spell level. Some spells are imitations of those of the Weave, with similar but often more powerful effects. Others have unique effects not shared by any other spells. However, such power comes as a price, as each spell the Shadow Adept uses also carries the risk of temporarily draining the caster’s Constitution, causing the risk of death if too many spells are cast in succession. The more powerful the spell, the greater the cost.<br><br>The Shadow Adept is a mage kit with a completely unique spell selection with 100+ new spells to choose from. A lot of them are copies of existing spells but there are quite a few relatively unique ones in there.<br><br>On top of having variants for the mage, sorcerer and bard, multi-classed shadow adepts are available as kits under their respective base class combinations. Due to a certain limitation with the spell scribing process,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex" target="_blank"><span style="color: var(--bs-warning);">EEex</span></a>&nbsp;is required for the ability to dual-class.</p>
